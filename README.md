As in the problem statement it is asked that you have to analyse the sales of Sparkling wine of company ABC Estate Wines, so from analysis we have noticed that Sparkling wine sales are increasing up to year 1988 & after that it is having decreasing trend there is a clear seasonality can also be seen.
Since in previous questions we have built a table sorted in increasing RMSE and found that Triple Exponential Smoothing Model Alpha=0.1, Beta=0.9, Gamma=0.6 is having lowest RMSE of 339 this means that for building the Predictive model for Sparkling wine sales you have to take smoothing factor for Level is 0.1 & Smoothing factor for Trend is 0.9. That infers Trend factor is playing biggest role in predicting next year Sparkling wine sales & since seasonality smoothing factor is 0.6 so seasonality is playing less important role compared to trend. RMSE is the comparable factor , Lower the RMSE means that best optimized Model .

We can also observe the following.

 	The 4th Quarter is having the highest sales across all the year, 3rd Quarter is having second highest sales this may be due to winter season, thus we can infer that in winter Sparkling wine is more purchased by peoples 
  
 	Also from year- Month Boxplot we can notice that in the Month of December every year Wine sales are increasing, this might be due to Christmas, New Year and other festivals. 
 	In first decade The trend is increasing & in second decade trend in decreasing.
 	In the month of June average wine sales are lowest
